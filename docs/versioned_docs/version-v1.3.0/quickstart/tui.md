# TUI

The HyprDynamicMonitors TUI provides an interactive interface for managing Hyprland monitor configurations.

## Launch the TUI

```bash
hyprdynamicmonitors tui
```

The TUI can be used with or without a valid HyprDynamicMonitors configuration:
- **With config**: Full functionality including profile management
- **Without config**: Monitor manipulation and ephemeral application only

## Views

The TUI has two main views that you can switch between using `Tab`:

1. **Monitors View** - Edit monitor layouts, positions, modes, and settings
2. **Profile View** - Manage HyprDynamicMonitors profiles and configuration

![Switching between views](/previews/views.gif)

:::info
The profile view is available only when `--config` points to a valid `hyprdynamicmonitors` configuration. Without it, you can still experiment with monitors and apply settings, but cannot save them under `hyprdynamicmonitors`.

![Color profiles management](/previews/color.gif)

:::caution Known Limitation
Due to [`hyprctl` not yet supporting the output of these](https://github.com/fiffeek/hyprdynamicmonitors/issues/34), when you change the color preset and apply it, then reload the TUI, the color preset will mismatch and show `auto/default/srgb`. This will change as soon as the underlying issue in Hyprland is resolved.
:::

### Applying Changes

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `A` | Apply current monitor configuration to Hyprland (ephemeral, not persisted on disk) |
| `Y` | Confirm and apply |
| `N` or `Esc` | Cancel |

Shows confirmation prompt before applying.

![Applying changes](/previews/apply.gif)

## Profile View

The Profile view shows your HyprDynamicMonitors configuration and lets you save monitor layouts as profiles.

### Profile Management

#### Creating a New Profile

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | Create new profile from current monitor layout |
| `Enter` | Save the profile |
| `Esc` | Cancel |

Opens profile name input where you can type the profile name.

The profile will include:
- All connected monitors as required monitors (matched by description)
- Current monitor layout, modes, scales, positions, and settings

![Creating a new profile](/previews/create_profile.gif)

#### Editing an Existing Profile

When the current monitors match an existing profile:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `a` | Apply edited settings to the matching profile |
| `Y` | Confirm and update the profile |

| `e` | Edit the config file in your `$EDITOR` |

Shows confirmation prompt with profile name. After confirmation, the config is reloaded automatically.

![Editing an existing profile](/previews/edit_existing.gif)

### Profile Status Indicators

The TUI shows different status messages:

- **Profile: [name]** - Current monitors match this profile exactly
- **Monitor Count Mismatch** - Monitors match partially but count differs
- **No Matching Profile** - No profile matches current monitor setup

### Configuration

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `C` | Open the HyprDynamicMonitors config file in your default editor (defined by `$EDITOR`) |

## Tips

1. **Snapping**: Keep snapping enabled (default) for easier monitor alignment. When snapping is active, monitors automatically align to edges of other monitors within 50px.

2. **Follow Mode**: Enable f(o)llow mode (`o`) when moving monitors to keep them centered in the preview.

3. **Fullscreen Preview**: Use fullscreen mode (`F`) to get a better view when working with many monitors or complex layouts.

4. **Preview Before Applying**: All changes are shown in the preview immediately. You can experiment freely without affecting your actual configuration until you press `A` to apply **and confirm**.

5. **Profile Workflow**:
   - Arrange monitors in the Monitors view
   - Switch to Profile view with `Tab`
   - Create a new profile with `n` or update existing with `a`
   - The profile will be saved to your HyprDynamicMonitors config

6. **Panning**: Use panning mode (`p`) to explore large monitor layouts. The grid shows spacing dots that scale with zoom level.
